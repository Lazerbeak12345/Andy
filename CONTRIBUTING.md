## Versioning

>The version *must* be changed in the `package.json` file *every* time a change is made

Normal versioning: `v[HUGE change].[backwards-compat].[bug-or-issue]`

Pre-alfa, alfa, beta, etc:  `v[HUGE change*].[backwards-compat*].[bug-or-issue*]-[pre-alfa,alfa,beta,etc][large(noteworthy**)-change].[bug-or-issue]`

For example: `v1.4.7` or: `v3.2.6-beta5.2`

>When incrementing a number, all spots for numbers following must be reverted to zero

\* These don't change while in pre-alfa,alfa,beta,etc.
They merely stay as whatever version it was before it entered pre-alfa.
\*\* By "noteworthy" I mean this could potentially call for another release.
